# BloodBowl League Manager 2
The aim of the League Manager is to deliver a tool for leagues playing BloodBowl 2 from Cyanide Studio to organize themselves and keep track of their competitions and results.  
The overall tool is a combination of 3 elements:  
- [A web interface built with VueJS](https://github.com/XavierOlland/BloodBowl_LeagueManager2): to display the competitions, results and statistics.
- [A backend built with PHP](https://github.com/XavierOlland/BB_LM2_Backend): to update the data and serve it to the interface.
- [A phpBB forum](https://www.phpbb.com/): for coach to organize them.

You can see the whole project running for French Blood Bowl Baston League at [https://bbbl.fr](https://bbbl.fr)

## Before building

Building won't work because of missing images. Because we can't be sure to what extend ingame content is considered as fair use. This apply mainly to teams' logos and stadium images.
Please feel free to contact us for any help concerning that matter.

## To do after building

Change index extension to **php** file and add the following script at the end of the **head** section to ensure phpBB interaction.

`<script>  
    <?php  
      define('PHPBB_ROOT_PATH','./Forum/');  
      include('backend/vue-config.php');  
      echo "window.user = ".json_encode($user->data).";";  
      echo "window.admin = ".$admin  
    ?>  
  </script>`
